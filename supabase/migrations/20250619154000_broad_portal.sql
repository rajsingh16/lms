  # Fix RLS Policies to Resolve Infinite Recursion

  1. Problem
    - Current policies on user_profiles table are causing infinite recursion
    - Policies are querying user_profiles table from within user_profiles policies
    - This creates circular dependencies that prevent authentication

  2. Solution
    - Drop existing problematic policies
    - Create new policies that use auth.uid() directly without subqueries
    - Simplify admin checks to avoid recursion

  3. Changes
    - Remove policies that query user_profiles table from within user_profiles policies
    - Use direct auth.uid() comparisons
    - Create separate admin role check that doesn't cause recursion
