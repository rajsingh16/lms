/*
  # Fix RLS Policies to Resolve Infinite Recursion and Policy Conflicts

  1. Policy Updates
    - Remove problematic recursive policies on user_profiles
    - Simplify policies to avoid infinite recursion
    - Update branches and user_permissions policies
  
  2. Security Changes
    - Use direct auth.uid() comparisons instead of subqueries
    - Move complex admin checks to application layer
    - Maintain basic row-level security
